# DiscordBot-ProjectAzure
Project Azure is a discord bot I developed some time ago. Now it serves as a template to develop bots using Java and Javacord. Use the bot at your descression. You can use the code anyway you want to develop your own bots. All I ask is that this code not to be used in a mallicious way.
NOTE: The key used in the github repo is a dummy key(its not the actual bot key)

# Dependencies/Libraries Used

# Different Between Coatlicue and Azure Project
This bot was used to test features for the main bot Coatlicue. Even though it is no longer needed, this bot is file structured in a way where it can be a stand alone bot.

# How you can use this code
Coatlicue and Azure are both coded differently so there is no security risk. That being said, feel free to use this bot for inspiration to create your own discord bot!

# What To Expect In The Future with Project Azure / Contribution
The future of Azure is to help demonstrate how to build a discord bot. I am no longer developing this bot due to a cease and desist I got from youtube, but if any one of you want to take the bot further, feel free. You can copy the code and make your own, or make contributions to this repo!
