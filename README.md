# DiscordBot-ProjectAzure
Project Azure is a discord bot I am developing. 
The main function of this bot is to expirament features on a small
scale to then add them to Project Coatlicue. Project Coatlicue is also 
a discord bot that I am developing, but instead of being for 
expiraments, It will be releaced as a public bot for people to enjoy 
in their own servers.
NOTE: The key used in the github repo is a dummy key(its not the actual bot key)

# Dependencies/Libraries Used
JavaCord: https://github.com/Javacord/Javacord \
Gradle: https://gradle.org/ \
LavaPlayer: https://github.com/sedmelluq/lavaplayer \

# Different Between Coastline and Azure Project
This Project is used to experiment with new features before adding them onto the main discord bot(Coatlicue)

# How you can use this code
Coatlicue and Azure are both coded differently so there is no security risk. That being said, feel free to use this bot for inspiration to create your own discord bot!

# What To Expect In The Future with Project Azure
The future of Azure is to help demonstrate how to build a discord bot. I will continue to develop it and make it better.
Hopefully, I will get a team together to help develop this bot even further.
